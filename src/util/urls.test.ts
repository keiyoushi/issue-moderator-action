    Sunshine Butterfly Scans 1.4.29 (English)

    ### Source new URL

    wings.sbs

    ### Other details

    I have searched for previous issues about the matter of Sunshine Butterfly's changed domain. I checked the version of the last issue raised, and it is quite old. I saw that the current extension has been updated, but the domain remains unchanged.
